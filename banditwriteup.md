After having learnt that the The file * command determines the type of every file, I used it but just like at level 1, the file names here also started with a dash so the command is going to be slightly different

Since the task said that the The password is stored somewhere on the server, I changed
find . -type f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 to find . -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 so that the search is not restricted to files only.
After knowing what 'somewhere on the server' actually meant, I tried find / -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 to start searching from the root directory but this gave me a really long list of permission denied errors (along with the filename). Finally I found the password using find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null which redirected the error messages and returned only the output file

Came across the term 'grep' while working on Level 5 and was confused between find and grep. But now the difference is clear
